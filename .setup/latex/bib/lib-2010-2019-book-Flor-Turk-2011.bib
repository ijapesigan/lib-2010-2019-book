  abstract = {This volume provides a psychobiological perspective on people who experience chronic pain and describes a comprehensive approach to their treatment. The text focuses on the interaction of psychosocial (psychological, behavioral, and social) and physiological processes in people with chronic pain and the implications that follow. Our basic hypothesis is that chronic pain is a learned response, whereby ``pain memories'' rather than current nociceptive input determine much of the pain experienced. Moreover, interdisciplinary approaches that integrate psychological principles and approaches with traditional biomedical knowledge in the assessment and treatment of people with chronic pain are more fruitful than any single modalities, be they physical (surgery, medication, regional anesthesia, or neuroaugmentive interventions) or psychological (biofeedback, counseling, or psychotherapy). Although our emphasis is on the role of psychological and social factors in chronic pain states, we attempt to integrate these aspects with the current biological understanding of the neurophysiology of nociception.},
